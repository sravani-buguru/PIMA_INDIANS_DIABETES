# PIMA_INDIANS_DIABETES_PROJECT

# Description:
Developed and implemented machine learning models to predict the onset of diabetes in Pima Indian women. Utilized the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which consists of clinical measurements and a binary outcome variable indicating the presence of diabetes.

Machine Learning for Applied supervised learning algorithms to build predictive models.

By using Data Preprocessing ,Cleaned and transformed data for model training.

Used Feature Engineering for Creating additional features to improve model performance.

By Model Evaluation,Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

# Project Highlights:
Successfully implemented various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Achieved an accuracy of over 80% in predicting diabetes onset.

Performed feature selection and engineered new features to improve model performance.

Analyzed and interpreted feature importance to understand the key factors contributing to diabetes
